# LunchRush
Here is a blast from my past that I dug up from an hold harddrive. It is the end of the year 2009. I was working for a company that used an internally developed 3D engine called GOSE to develop interactive trainings. But it just isn't very good and the decision to port all of our trainings to Unity3D has been made. But there is only one person in the department with any experience with Unity3D, and he's the artist. So my co-worker and I organized a 24 hour Game Jam. After working a normal day, we then proceeded to break up into two groups of 3 or 4 members, got our prompt, and started learning Unity3D on the spot.

This is what my team came up with 24 hours later. Looking back, it isn't really that bad, considering. My least favorite part is the camera, but it was 2am and one of my team members had read about a game that had the camera on a spring or cloth simulation. Bad ideas take on their own life after almost 26 hours of being at work.

I've since worked on many Unity3D projects, so don't take this as an actual measure of my skill. It is just an interesting archeaological artifact from my far past. For some reason, this one survived while my more recent examples for terrain generation and boids have been lost.
